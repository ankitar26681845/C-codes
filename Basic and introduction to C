C is the topmost and basic programming which is important for every programmer.
C is the basic and advance both type of programming language by which we can create another programming language and most of the programming languages are already based on this such as c++, ruby, and many more. Lots of the games, search engines and webpages are created with the help of c program. 
This is our basic introduction about this programming language 
Before starting of this program i would like to explain some parts and other things which is important and by the help of this it will be easy and helpful during programming 
such as types of OS(operating system)- mac, Window, linuxetc
now for this program we must have a compilier on which we can decode the program and we musgt have the codding platform such as devC, or any online platform.
some common parts of the c program such as 




header(in which we use #, such as #include<stdio.h>, #include<conio.h> etc)
then after that global declaration(mainly use in fucntion but sometimes it use in other also such as pointer and alot)
then main function such as (int main(), void main())
then 
declaration part in which we declare and write the code and program 
then 
executable part in which we execute the local variable 
then function call
then user defined function 
then body of the function 
but some time we by ourself change the place of these things like we can give comment to anywhere.
